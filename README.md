# Deep Learning from Scratch üß†
Welcome to **Deep Learning from Scratch**, a repository where I implement fundamental deep learning architectures from scratch using **Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow**. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how neural networks function internally, without relying on high-level libraries.

## üìå Implemented Architectures

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

   - Implemented a simple **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**.
   - Trained using **CUDA** for GPU acceleration.
   - [Code Directory](https://github.com/Ishaan-Ansari/Deep-Learning-from-scratch.git)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**

   - Built a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for a **Q&A system**.
   - Explores sequence-based architectures and **vanishing gradients**.
   - [Code Directory](https://github.com/Ishaan-Ansari/Deep-Learning-from-scratch.git)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

   - Implemented **CNNs from scratch**.
   - Performed **Transfer Learning using VGG16**.
   - [Code Directory](https://github.com/Ishaan-Ansari/Deep-Learning-from-scratch.git)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Implemented **GANs from scratch** in **PyTorch and TensorFlow**.
   - Covers **Generator and Discriminator networks** for synthetic data generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ishaan-Ansari/Deep-Learning-from-scratch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific model:
   ```bash
   cd Deep-Learning-from-scratch/[Folder_Name]
   ```
3. Run Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook.
